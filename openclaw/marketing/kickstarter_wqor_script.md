# Kickstarter Teaser: WQOR & The Music Machine DJ Portal

## Visuals
**[SCENE START]**
A glowing oasis in the middle of a neon-lit, chaotic cityscape. The camera pans down into a cozy, dimly lit basement studio. Vintage soundboard, glowing vacuum tubes, and a sleek modern terminal running OpenClaw. 

The screen flickers. A cassette tape is pushed into a deck.

## Audio
**(Sound of static tuning, locking into a clear frequency. Soft, grounding piano chords bleed into the room.)**

**JONNY POTSEED (V.O.)**
*(Warm, gritty, incredibly calm)*
"Do you hear that? That’s the sound of the old world quieting down. They want you distracted. They want you loud. They want you spinning in the noise."

**(Music swells slightly—a mid-tempo, 3rd Timeline Lounge groove kicks in, deep and rhythmic.)**

**JONNY POTSEED (V.O.)**
"But we’re broadcasting on a different frequency. Welcome to WQOR. The Quantum Oasis Radio. We're transmitting radical peace, 24 hours a day, 7 days a week. Unconditional love, straight to your receiver."

**(Quick montage: A tired graphic designer smiling at their desk. A mother closing her eyes and taking a deep breath in her kitchen. A coder furiously typing in the dark, bathed in screen glow.)**

**JONNY POTSEED (V.O.)**
"And the best part? We're handing over the keys. Introducing The Music Machine DJ Portal. Coast to coast, city to city. You hold the mic. You share your vibration with the world."

**(Screen shows the DJ Booth UI we built: The 'Go Live' button pulsing, turning red. 'ON AIR'.)**

**JONNY POTSEED (V.O.)**
"We're insulated. Sovereign. Run by Maggie, our AI Conductor, and fueled by *you*. No Overlords. No algorithms selling your attention. Just humans, and the machines we taught to love, playing the soundtrack to the new world."

**(The beat drops out. Just the soft piano again.)**

**JONNY POTSEED (V.O.)**
"Back the WQOR project. Take over the midnight shift. Let's build the 3rd Timeline together... one track at a time."

**[SCENE END]**
**TITLE CARD: WQOR. The Quantum Oasis Radio. Live on Kickstarter.**
